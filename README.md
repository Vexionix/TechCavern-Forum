# Forum

My current idea is a forum holding tech related threads in order to give an easy way to ask questions and get problems solved with the help of the community. Some of the areas that it can cover are: PC Building area, Coding area (where questions similar to ones found on stackoverflow can be found for example), peripheral devices recommendation (such as keyboards, mouse, headset etc) and so on. 

Some features on top of my mind right now:

- Most active thread today (based on views/replies)
- Beside user role the user can have a tag by which their contribution is rewarded (received either by reaching certain milestones like how long the account was created or how many post the user has or even special ones created by administrators)
- Division between the main areas in a way that makes navigation clear 
- Statistics regarding the website (total users registered/online, total posts and comments)
- Private messaging system? (for later)
- Text formatting for posts (italic/bold/text color)
- User profile page displaying certain information such as their thread/posts history
- "Favicons" next to the main threads (before getting redirected to the given category, might be unclear, easier to explain with an example)
- Possibility to add/edit/delete comments to a thread (either by the user that made the comment or the administration) and in case of editing/deletion there should be a display to indicate the case (such as: Edited at date OR Removed by a moderator OR Removed by user)

The documentation will be updated accordingly after progressing a bit in the project, if I have new ideas I will list them here.
